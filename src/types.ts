   * Battery state of this sensor's physical probe, derived from AWN's
   * batt* field that corresponds to the same hardware module (e.g.
   * `tempf` → `battout`, `tempinf` → `battin`, `temp1f` → `batt1`,
   * `lightning_*` → `batt_lightning`, `*_aqin` → `batt_co2`).
   *
   * undefined → AWN does not report a battery for this sensor's
   *             probe (or the field is missing from the payload).
   *             The wrapper skips the Battery sub-service entirely.
   * true       → battery is low (AWN reports the batt field as 0).
   * false      → battery is normal (AWN reports the batt field as 1).
   *
   * AWN's batt* field convention is 0 = low / 1 = good — opposite of
   * HomeKit's BATTERY_LEVEL_LOW boolean intuition. The platform
   * inverts at the parseDevices boundary so wrappers see the
   * HomeKit-aligned meaning.
